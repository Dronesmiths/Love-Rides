# Implementation Plan: Love Rides "Winterized" Homepage

This plan outlines the pivot of the Love Rides website from a past-event focus (Ride 34) to a "Legacy & Foundation" focus for the 2026 off-season.

## 1. Research & Analysis
- [x] Read current site content from `loveride.org`.
- [x] Identify key legacy metrics ($25M+ raised, 30+ years).
- [x] Identify key stakeholders (Oliver Shokouh, Love Ride Foundation).
- [x] Identify supported charities (Wounded Warrior Project, Adopt the Arts).

## 2. Design Strategy (Winterized Vibe)
- **Palette**: Gritty blacks, Harley-Davidson oranges/yellows, polished chrome/silver accents.
- **Typography**: Bold, industrial headers (e.g., Space Grotesk or a slab serif) and clean, readable body text (Inter).
- **Imagery**: High-fidelity cinematic motorcycle shots, historical event crowds (black and white or sepia accents for legacy sections).

## 3. Structural Components
- **Hero**: "A Legacy That Rides On" - Cinematic video or image background with a focus on the heritage and the $25M impact.
- **The Statistics**: A counter or grid showing the scale of the impact (Years, Dollars, Charities).
- **The Foundation**: Profile of Oliver Shokouh and the 501(c)(3) mission.
- **Impact Showcase**: Cards or a carousel for Wounded Warrior Project, Adopt the Arts, etc.
- **Connect**: A clean lead-capture form to notify users about Ride 35 (November 2026).

## 4. Technical Stack
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for high-performance static delivery.
- AWS S3 + CloudFront (standard for this portfolio).
- Responsive, mobile-first design.

## 5. Execution Steps
- [ ] Receive/Review "old screenshots" from USER for specific layout preferences.
- [ ] Generate modern versions of these layouts using rich aesthetics (gradients, glassmorphism, micro-animations).
- [ ] Build the `index.html` structure.
- [ ] Implement `styles.css` with the "Winterized" design system.
- [ ] Add interactive elements (counters, hover effects).
- [ ] Deploy to local server (port 8000) for review.
